### Clicks
We track unique clicks to your site so you can measure performance.

**Fraud controls include**

- Anomaly review for suspicious spikes

---

## What We Do Not Promise (Yet)

We provide visibility and market context. We do **not** promise:
- Guaranteed click volume
- Guaranteed conversion rates
- Guaranteed “best price” status

Market conditions change. Data quality varies by category. We optimize for clarity and consistency.

## Questions?

If you want to validate value quickly, start with STARTER.

If you already get steady demand, STANDARD is usually the best starting point.

PRO is designed for dealers who manage pricing actively and want deeper context.
