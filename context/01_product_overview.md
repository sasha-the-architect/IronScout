# Product Overview

IronScout helps users understand ammo pricing over time and act when it matters.

Rather than presenting endless lists of prices, IronScout focuses on **monitoring**, **context**, and **timing**.

---

## The Problem

Ammo prices are volatile and fragmented.

Retailers publish inconsistent listings.  
Prices change frequently.  
Inventory comes and goes without warning.

Most tools show static snapshots:
- Long lists
- Cheapest-first sorting
- No memory of what the user cares about

This creates noise, not confidence.

## What IronScout Is

IronScout is a **market monitoring product**, not a marketplace.

Users search to explore.  
They save what they care about.  
IronScout watches the market continuously.

When something changes in a meaningful way, IronScout surfaces it.

Canonical grouping aims to show one product with prices across multiple retailers whenever possible.

---

## How It Works

IronScout operates as a loop:

1. **Search** to discover current prices and availability.
2. **Save** items of interest.
3. **Monitor** price and availability over time.
4. **Surface** moments worth attention via the Dashboard or alerts.

Quiet days are normal.  
Silence is intentional.

## Gun Locker (Optional)

Gun Locker lets users optionally tell IronScout what calibers they shoot by adding guns (caliber required, nickname optional). This information is used only to improve relevance and ordering in search, dashboards, and surfaced price changes.

Gun Locker is not a firearm registry, inventory system, or purchase planner. It does not store serial numbers, purchase details, or counts; it does not verify ownership; and it does not generate recommendations.

Gun Locker exists to reduce noise, not to make decisions for the user.

## What Makes IronScout Different

IronScout does not try to tell users what to buy.

Instead, it:
- Normalizes messy retailer data
- Groups equivalent products
- Tracks change over time
- Surfaces moments selectively

This reduces noise and builds trust.

---

## Role of Automation

Automation is used to:
- Normalize inconsistent listings
- Detect price and availability changes
- Support reliable monitoring at scale

Automation does not:
- Make purchase decisions
- Assign deal scores
- Predict future prices
- Surface recommendations or verdicts

Outcomes are based on observable data, not claims of intelligence.

---

## The Dashboard

The Dashboard is a **status-oriented monitoring surface** (ADR-020).

It answers:
> "What is the current state of what I'm tracking, and what has changed recently?"

On most days, the answer is "no meaningful change yet."

That restraint is deliberate.

---

## Alerts

Alerts are rare interruptions for time-sensitive moments.

They exist to prevent missed opportunities, not to drive engagement.

Users are alerted only when immediate action provides clear value.

---

## Who IronScout Is For

IronScout is for users who:
- Care about timing, not just price
- Prefer fewer signals over constant noise
- Want to stay informed without checking daily

It is designed for real-world buying behavior, not constant browsing.

## Summary

IronScout watches the market so users don’t have to.

When it speaks, it matters.
